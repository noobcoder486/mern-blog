First Started Installing React using Vite

Then installed Tailwind css for design

Then created 5 pages in the pages folder

Then added routes for those pages

Then created a header component in component folder

For ready made bootstrap used, Flowbite-react which is kinda tailwind css framework

Then created the Header using Flowbite

After that created backend folder named 'api'

In that first installed Express js server
 
In that api folder created a index.js page as the package.json needs index.js post installing express

After that need to change the type to module in package.json as it is needed for running express

Wrote some code for running express server.

Server needs to be stopped and start again for detecting changes. To overcome this, installed nodemon.

Wrote a small script in package.json for running the server with custom command.
